Can we eliminate more patterns?
- 1 or 2 T's (3/4 for case 8) have been already used
- Maybe try doing random T-Gates on each of the patterns to see what happens

Create a map of pattern -> possible pattern -> case(s) or subcase(s) or pattern(s)

Track and output if a FULL LDE reduction is done (aka LDE is -1 everywhere)
- Print out the final LDEs on each of the possible patterns


Can we reduce the possible patterns?

Create a data file for which T-gates we use for each case

Multipy 2 valid patterns (need to implement the * operator)
- see what we get (should it be a valid?)
- is reduction pattern the product of 2 valid patterns?
- (A1 + B1 root2)(A2 + B2 root2)
- try working this out by hand (??) and mod2 it
-- easier in code and need to reduce down to a pattern
- Need to deal with LDEs???  and reduction???

CODE CLEAN UP
- tests, tests, and more tests
- clean up, split up, and make it a bit easier to work with
- move things into data files
